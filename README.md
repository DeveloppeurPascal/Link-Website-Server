# Block Page Site Server

[Cette page en fran√ßais.](LISEZMOI.md)

This project is a multilingual website engine developed in PHP. It supports page routing, redirects, SEO, social media sharing, a cache system, and multi-level page templates.

Pages are defined as sets of blocks that you can use from the default template. You can, of course, create your own page templates and blocks.

Data is stored in JSON files. Database storage (more suitable for large sites) is also an option.

This site engine does not have an administration interface but offers an API for updating its database. Software and client back offices for this API will be available. They will be listed on the project website.

You can use this engine to create your own sites and benefit from the included features, provided you comply with the minimum information requirements for the three types of database files. The rest is entirely autonomous.

## Talks and conferences

### Twitch

Follow my development streams of software, video games, mobile applications and websites on [my Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/patrickpremartin) or as replays on [Serial Streameur](https://serialstreameur.fr) mostly in French.

## Using this script

Copy the files from the ./src subfolder to your site location (root of a domain, subdomain, or subfolder of an existing site).

Display the home page and copy the information indicated in your version of the site generator.

Once this is done, the program will switch to data display mode, and you will only need to fill it in using the software.

You can also [visit the script website](https://blockpagesiteserver.trucs-de-developpeur-web.fr) to find out more about how it works, access videos and articles, find out about the different versions available and their features, contact user support...

## Source code installation

To download this code repository, we recommend using "git", but you can also download a ZIP file directly from [its GitHub repository](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/Link-Website-Server).

## Compatibility

When I code, I work locally with XAMPP on Windows. My projects work for this stack.

There's no guarantee of compatibility with other software or versions, even though I try to keep my code clean and avoid using too many specific things.

If you detect any anomalies on earlier versions, please don't hesitate to [report them](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/Link-Website-Server/issues) so that I can test and try to correct or provide a workaround.
